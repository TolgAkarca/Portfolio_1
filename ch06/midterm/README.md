CS110 Midterm Exam


My project is : My country's flag. I drew this flag because Turkey will be 100 years old on October 29th.


I don't thing there is a bug. Also it don't have any incomplate parts


I only use in-class materials 



I tried to be unique I never heard about someone gonna draw their countries flag.
